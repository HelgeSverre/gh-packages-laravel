    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your database and other settings.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5. **Configure database:**

    Update your `.env` file with your database credentials:
    ```env
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=asset_management
    DB_USERNAME=your_username

8. **Start the queue worker (for import/export functionality):**

    ```bash
    php artisan queue:work database --queue=imports,exports,default --sleep=0
    ```

9. **Set up the Task Scheduler (for automated asset status updates):**

    The system includes an automated job that updates asset statuses to "Inactive" when they reach their retirement date. This runs daily at 2:00 AM.

    **For Windows (XAMPP):**

    a. Open **Task Scheduler** (search "Task Scheduler" in Start Menu)

    b. Click **"Create Task..."** (not "Create Basic Task")

    c. **General Tab:**
       - Name: `Laravel Asset Management Scheduler`
       - Description: `Runs Laravel scheduler every minute`
       - Check "Run whether user is logged on or not" (Do not check when user password is unknown or user does not have privileges)
       - Check "Run with highest privileges"

    d. **Triggers Tab:**
       - Click **New...**
       - Begin the task: **"On a schedule"**
       - Settings: **"Daily"**
       - Start: Today's date and set time to 02:00 AM
       - Recur every: **1 day**
       - **Advanced settings:**
         - Check "Repeat task every: **1 minute**"
         - For a duration of: **"Indefinitely"**

    e. **Actions Tab:**
       - Click **New...**
       - Action: **"Start a program"**
       - Program/script: `C:\xampp\php\php.exe`
       - Add arguments: `artisan schedule:run`
       - Start in: `C:\xampp\htdocs\first-balfour-asset-management-system` (specify the specific repository path)

    f. **Settings Tab:**
       - Check "Allow task to be run on demand"
       - Check "Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed"
       - Check "If the running task does not end when requested, force it to stop"

    g. Click **OK** and enter your Windows password when prompted

    **For Linux/Unix (Production):**

    Add this line to your crontab:
    ```bash
    * * * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
    ```

10. **Serve the application:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Task Scheduler Management

### Monitoring the Scheduler

The automated asset status update job runs daily at 2:00 AM. Here's how to monitor and manage it:

#### **Check Scheduled Tasks**
```bash
# View all scheduled tasks
php artisan schedule:list

# Run scheduler manually (for testing, needs timing with the specified time to run)
php artisan schedule:run
```

#### **Manual Asset Status Update**
```bash
# Dry run (see what would be updated without making changes, safe to run)
php artisan assets:update-retired-status --dry-run --limit=5

# Update specific number of assets
php artisan assets:update-retired-status --limit=10

# Update all eligible assets
php artisan assets:update-retired-status
```

#### **Log Monitoring**
```bash
# Check scheduler execution logs
type storage\logs\scheduler.log

# Check detailed job logs
findstr "UpdateRetiredAssetsStatus" storage\logs\laravel.log

# Monitor logs in real-time
# Windows: Use PowerShell or Command Prompt
Get-Content storage\logs\laravel.log -Wait -Tail 20
```

#### **Troubleshooting**

**If the scheduler isn't running:**
1. Check Windows Task Scheduler for the task status
2. Verify the task is enabled and running
3. Check the "Last Run Time" and "Last Run Result" in Task Scheduler
4. Ensure PHP path is correct in the task action

**If assets aren't being updated:**
1. Apache and MySQL should be running
2. Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for error messages
3. Verify asset retirement dates are set correctly
4. Ensure the "Inactive" asset status exists in the database
5. Run the command manually to test: `php artisan assets:update-retired-status --limit=1`

**If you see "No scheduled commands are ready to run":**
- This is normal when it's not 2:00 AM yet
- The scheduler checks every minute but only runs jobs at their scheduled times

### **Log Locations**
